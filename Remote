Remote:

Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere. It may be on your local computer.
Remote Repository resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple team members.
"git remote command" lists the shortnames of each remote handle you’ve specified. If you’ve cloned your repository, you should at least see origin – that is the default name Git gives to the server you cloned from

"git branch -r" will list the remote branch.



Commits:

The "commit" operation enables you to record changes that were made to a file or directory in the Git history.By commiting every change made, you will be able to view all changes chronologically in the respective file or directory.
