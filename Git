Git

Git is a system for version control used by programmers and others who write code. It runs at the command line on your local machine.
It allows you to keep track of your files and modification to those files using repository.Everyone in a team can work independently on those files, merge changes together. You can't lose information in a transit or get file corruption without Git being able to detect it.

Git's user interface stores and thinks it's data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature file system. Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at the moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. 



GitHub

GitHub is a website that allows you to upload your Git repositories online. It provides a backup of your files. It gives you a visual interface for navigating your repos as well as other repos.You build a profile, upload projects to share and connect with other users by “following” their accounts.
