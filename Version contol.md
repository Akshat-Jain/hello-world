Version Control

Version control is a system to record and track the changes one made to a any file or any project. Basically, It stores every change or commit one made to file, so that it can be recalled at later stage. It allows you to revert selected files or entire project back to previous state. One can compare changes over time, check who last modified or introduced an issue. It allows one to work together and collaborate in a more efficient manner.it manages changes to a project without overwriting any part of that project.
