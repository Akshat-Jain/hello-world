Repository

It is a storage space or a directory where you can store your projects. It can be local to your computer, or it can be on GitHub or another online host. You can keep code files, text files, images inside a repo.



Fork

A Fork is a copy of a repository.GitHub will make a copy of the project that is entirely yours.	 It allows you to freely experiment with the changes without affecting the original project.

A fork is just a request for GitHub to clone the project and registers it under your username. Any changes made to the original original repository will be reflected back to your forked repository. However, if you make any changes to your forked repository you will have to explicitly create a pull request to the original repository. When your pull request is approved by the administrator of the original repository, then your changes will be merged with the existing original code-base. Until then, your changes will be reflected only in the copy you forked.



Clone

Cloning a git repository means that you create a local copy of the code provided by developer.
A Clone is where you have proper duplication, and separation between, two versions of a repository. When one repository is amended, the new content must be actively copied to the other repository using a push command. And changes in the other repository are fetched.

Basic difference between fork and clone

Fork - Making copy of repository from original to your github profile
Clone - Making copy of repository from github to your local machine(pc)
