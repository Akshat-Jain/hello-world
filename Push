Push:

In order to start sharing our changes with others, we have to push them to a remote repository using the "push" command. This will cause the remote repository to update and synchronize with our local repository.



Pull:

When somebody pushes their changes to the shared remote repository, your local repository becomes out of date.
Do a "pull" operation to pull the changes from the remote repository onto your local repository.
When pull is executed, the latest revision history is downloaded from the remote repository and imported to your local repository.



Pull request:

Create a pull request to propose and collaborate on changes to a repository. These changes are proposed in a branch, which ensures that the master branch only contains finished and approved work.

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before the changes are merged into the repository.

To create PR:

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. In the "Branch" menu, choose the branch that contains your commits.
3. To the right of the Branch menu, click New pull request.
4. Use the base branch dropdown menu to select the branch you'd like to merge your changes into, then use the compare branch drop-down menu to choose the topic branch you made your changes in.
5. Type a title and description for your pull request.
6. Click Create pull request.
